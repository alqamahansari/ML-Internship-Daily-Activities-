# Machine Learning Internship – Daily Practice

This repository documents my **daily machine learning practice work** carried out during an **ongoing Python-based Machine Learning internship**.  
Each commit reflects **day-wise learning progress**, with emphasis on **conceptual understanding, clean implementation, and reproducibility**.


## Objectives
- Build strong Python foundations for Machine Learning
- Apply statistical concepts using **synthetic and real-world datasets**
- Implement ML algorithms **step by step from scratch**
- Develop disciplined version control habits through **daily Git commits**


## Topics Practiced
- Python fundamentals for data analysis
- NumPy and Pandas
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Train–test split and data pipelines
- Linear and polynomial regression (introductory)
- Model evaluation and performance analysis


## Repository Structure
The repository is organized sequentially to reflect a **concept-first learning approach**, progressing from Python basics to regression modeling.

- Numbered notebooks indicate **learning order**
- Datasets are stored separately to ensure **reproducibility**


## Activity Style
- Short, focused practice notebooks
- Clear variable naming and readable code
- Commented logic for self-explanation
- Gradual increase in complexity
- Consistent commits for accountability and progress tracking


## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Git & GitHub  


## Datasets
All datasets included in this repository are **synthetically generated or publicly available** and are used strictly for **educational and learning purposes**.


## Status
🟢 **Internship ongoing (until March 2026)**  
This repository will continue to be updated as new concepts and models are explored.
